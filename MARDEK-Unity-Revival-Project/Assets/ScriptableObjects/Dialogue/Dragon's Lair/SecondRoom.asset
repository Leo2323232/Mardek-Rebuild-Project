  transcript: 'Deugan

    Remember Mardek, with our super-duper Hero Powers, we''re
    practically invincible if we successfully use all our Reactions well enough with
    the X key right when we attack or get attacked! But we''ve got to get the timing
    right, so let''s experiment a bit, and use these Reactions to our advantage!

    (Apparently
    I have to mention this or else you''ll probably not figure out that reaction
    commands exist at all.)

    Mardek

    ...Huh?

    Deugan

    Let''s just
    continue on our way, Mardek! Tally-ho!'
