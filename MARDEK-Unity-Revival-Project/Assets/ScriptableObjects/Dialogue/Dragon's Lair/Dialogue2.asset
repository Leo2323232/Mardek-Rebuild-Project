  - Remember Mardek, with our super-duper Hero Powers, we're practically invincible
    if we successfully use all our Reactions well enough with the X key right when
    we attack or get attacked! But we've got to get the timing right, so let's experiment
    a bit, and use these Reactions to our advantage!
  - (Apparently I have to mention this or else you'll probably not figure out that
    reaction commands exist at all.)
  - ...Huh?
  - Let's just continue on our way, Mardek! Tally-ho!
