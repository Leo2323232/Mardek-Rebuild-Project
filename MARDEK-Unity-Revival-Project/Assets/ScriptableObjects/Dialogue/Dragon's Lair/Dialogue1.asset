  - Well Deugan, this is The Dragon's Lair!
  - Yes, Mardek, that it is! We have to get to the dragon and slay it to rescue the
    Princess! Tally-ho!
  - What does 'tally-ho' mean?
  - Uhm... I'm not sure! But I've heard adventurers say it before maybe! It sounds
    like something they'd say!
  - Tally-ho!
  - Tally-ho! We're adventurers! En guard! Forsooth! Bloody goblins!
  - Tally-ho!
  - Now let's go and save that Princess! Tally-ho!
  - Oh, but Mardek, just a reminder about things! We can open the menu with the ENTER
    key to check our stats, skills and items, or to save! And we can also open doors
    and talk to people and stuff with the X key! Remember these things!
  - It might be a good idea to read the Help section of the menu now if you didn't
    read the Instructions already!
  - ...Huh?
  - Uh, I mean... Tally-ho! Let's go and slay that dragon!
