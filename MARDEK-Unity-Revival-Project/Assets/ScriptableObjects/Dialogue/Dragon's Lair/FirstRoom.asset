  transcript: 'Mardek

    Well Deugan, this is The Dragon''s Lair!

    Deugan

    Yes,
    Mardek, that it is! We have to get to the dragon and slay it to rescue the Princess!
    Tally-ho!

    Mardek

    What does ''tally-ho'' mean?

    Deugan

    Uhm...
    I''m not sure! But I''ve heard adventurers say it before maybe! It sounds like
    something they''d say!

    Mardek

    Tally-ho!

    Deugan

    Tally-ho!
    We''re adventurers! En guard! Forsooth! Bloody goblins!

    Mardek

    Tally-ho!

    Deugan

    Now
    let''s go and save that Princess! Tally-ho!

    Oh, but Mardek, just a reminder
    about things! We can open the menu with the ENTER key to check our stats, skills
    and items, or to save! And we can also open doors and talk to people and stuff
    with the X key! Remember these things!

    It might be a good idea to read
    the Help section of the menu now if you didn''t read the Instructions already!

    Mardek

    ...Huh?

    Deugan

    Uh,
    I mean... Tally-ho! Let''s go and slay that dragon!'
