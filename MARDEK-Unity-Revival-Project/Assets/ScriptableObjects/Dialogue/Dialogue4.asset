  - OH DEAR!! I HAVE BEEN SLAIN!!!
  - Well, we beated the dragon!
  - Oh thank you so much for saving me, mighty heroes!
  - Well it was really all my fault.
  - All your *fault*? Do you mean all your *doing* or something? Because that's not
    fair! We beat the dragon together...
  - Well I still get the princess.
  - You can have her! She's a *giiirl*! Girls are headlice, I heard! They suck on
    your wallet and drain out all your money, that's what my dad says!
  - Really?!
  - Yeh, really! My dad told me so it must be true!
  - Now that we've beatened the dragon though, now what do we do?
