  _description: One of the Elemental Crystals. It provides the essence of water,
    which is necessary for life. Without the water crystal, the waters of Belfan
    would stagnate, and all life in seas would perish (as well as any animal that
    requires water to sustain them). The Water Crystal is currently located on the
    Hadris continent, but its specific lcoation is a closely-guarded secret.
