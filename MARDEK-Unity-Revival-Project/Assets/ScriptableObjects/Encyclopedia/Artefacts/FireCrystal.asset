  _description: One of the Elemental Crystals. It provides the essence of life and
    energy, of heat and of fire. Without the power of the Fire Crystal, Belfan would
    surely fall into an ice age. The Fire Crystal is currently located in a temple
    in a cave south of Aeropolis on the Fengue continent.
