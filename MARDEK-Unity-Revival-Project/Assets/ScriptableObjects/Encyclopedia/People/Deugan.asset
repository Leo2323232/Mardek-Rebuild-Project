  _fullDescription: Mardek's best friend, and 'adventuring partner'. Together, the
    two boys aspire to be Grand Adventurers like their hero Social Fox, going on
    adventures and saving people from dragons and such. Deugan's more level-headed
    and analytical than his friend, and tends to take things more seriously. Though
    he can become slightly exasperated by Mardek's dim-witted, carefree brashness
    at times, he's still very loyal to him and values their friendship deeply.
