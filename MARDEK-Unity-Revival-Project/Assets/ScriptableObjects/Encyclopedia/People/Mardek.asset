  _fullDescription: Well, he's a young boy from Goznor, who, together with his best
    friend Deugan, wishes to one day become a Grand Adventurer and go on quests and
    save people. As it is though, all he can do is pretend until he's old enough
    to go on a REAL adventure. He's a bit dim at times, but he's well-meaning and
    has a big heart.
