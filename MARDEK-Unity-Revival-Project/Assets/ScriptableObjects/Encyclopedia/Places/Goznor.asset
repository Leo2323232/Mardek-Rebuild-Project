  _description: A small village that, despite its size, is the capital of the nation
    of Gonoroth, on the continent of Hadris on Belfan. The village of Goznor is inhabited
    by simple folk and mainly consists of shops. There's also a Yalortian monastery,
    and a barracks for the Town Guard (which get litte work due to the calmness of
    the place). Castle Goznor is to the north, where the king of Goznor (and Gonoroth)
    rules from.
