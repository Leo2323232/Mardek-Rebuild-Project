  _description: Second planet in the Girru System. A smallish, Type B world inhabited
    mostly by humans, though reptoids are also known to dwell here in small numbers.
    It is an Undeveloped world, still stuck in its 'medieval' ages, barely knowing
    of the other worlds in its own system let alone any others elsewhere. The star,
    Girru, is in a binary relationship with the nearby star Nusku. Nusku orbits Girru
    extremely quickly, and every few hundred years the two systems come close to
    each other and Nusku and its planets can be observed from Belfan.
